## 🎯 Overview
A lightweight and powerful checkpoint system for Paper servers. Set personal checkpoints and teleport back to them instantly!

## ✨ Features

### Core Commands

#### `/cp set` - Set your current location as a checkpoint
*   You can use `/cp set [Co-Ordinates]`
*   Saves your exact position, including pitch and yaw
*   Displays coordinates confirmation

#### `/cp go` - Teleport back to your saved checkpoint
*   Instant teleportation with no delay
*   Helpful error messages if no checkpoint is set

#### `/cp tp <player>` - Teleport a player to their checkpoint
*   Supports player names: `/cp tp Steve`
*   Supports selectors: `/cp tp @a` (all players)
*   Supports tag filtering: `/cp tp @a[tag=ready]`
*   Requires `checkpoint.tp` permission (OP by default)

### Advanced Integration
*   **Full `/execute` support** - All commands work seamlessly with command blocks and functions
    *   Example: `/execute as @a[tag=racing] run cp go`
    *   Example: `/execute as PlayerName run cp set`

### User Experience
